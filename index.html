        <h4>You play DRUMS!</h4>
        <img></img>
        <p>You are a highly skilled musician, and most people don't even notice because you look so cool. Nobody in the band is going to fuck with you because you are in control of the time and nobody wins when the drummer is mad. You probably have
          good hair.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id=a12>
        <h4>You play KEYBOARDS!</h4>
        <img></img>
        <p>All of those years of piano lessons have payed off, and now you get to tour around and play easy parts you could do in your sleep. Your bandmates will ask you to referee musical questions, but you don't like being the center of attention.
          You like wearing sunglasses on stage so that people in the audience can't see how bored you are.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id=a13>
        <h4>You play VIOLIN!</h4>
        <img></img>
        <p>All those years of lessons and here you are to play the intro on a couple of songs. You don't tell people you play in a rock band because they look so disappointed when you tell them what you play. Even you think you can be replaced by a
          sample played from a laptop.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id=a21>
        <h4>You play RHYTHM GUITAR!</h4>
        <img></img>
        <p>Listen, there's only room for one guitar solo chasing diva in a band, and it didn't end up to be you. That's ok, though, playing in perfect time with drums and bass is harder than it looks, and your midlife crisis is going to be 80% less
          embarassing. Also, none of your bandmates will figure out that you own the copyright to all of your songs for another 10 years.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id=a22>
        <h4>You play BASS!</h4>
        <img></img>
        <p>You're the person in the band who holds down the bottom. Keeping good time with the drums isn't easy, but let's be real: you play one note at a time on an instrument with only four strings. You don't stand out on stage but look cool
          anytime someone looks over to you. You are probably bisexual, and none of your bandmates realize that you run the instagram page and all of their social media fans are really your fans.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id=a23>
        <h4>You play LEAD GUITAR!</h4>
        <img></img>
        <p>Your favorite things to say are "Can you turn me up?" and "I think this would be a great place for a guitar solo." You watched <em>A Goofy Movie</em> when you were four years old and thought Max was the coolest in the world. You decided
          you were going to play guitar, and you never revisited that dream. Your pal who plays rhythm guitar is probably a better player but you have more pedals.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id=a31>
        <h4>You are the LEAD SINGER!</h4>
        <img></img>
        <p>You are the face of the band. You like answering questions about the deep meaning of your songs, even though technically speaking all of your songs are written by the bass player. You're not so big on "practicing" or "counting" or "getting
          the right notes," but the fans are used to seeing you so it's too late to make any changes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id=a32>
        <h4>You are the WEIRD PERSON IN THE BACK WITH A LAPTOP!</h4>
        <img></img>
        <p>You didn't get into music to set up laptops on stage and click a mouse to trigger samples. In fact, you can play every instrument in the band. Unfortunately, you were better at using computers than the rest of your bandmates, and when it
          came time to set up the tour, all of the better instruments were taken. At least this way you can pretend to be a DJ on Tinder.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer" id=a33>
        <h4>You play the SAXOPHONE!</h4>
        <img></img>
        <p>Ten years ago your band had a radio hit with a saxophone solo on it. They put a sax solo in to be ironic, but now they have to pay you to go along with them whenever they go on tour. Your best friend is the person who plays handbells, you
          both have a lot of downtime.</p>
